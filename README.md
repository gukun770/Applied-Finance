>Use pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio

When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.

## Case 2: Exploring cryptocurrency market [View Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gukun770/Applied-Finance/blob/master/Exploring%20cryptocurrency%20market/Cryptocurrencies%20Market%20EDA.ipynb)

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.
